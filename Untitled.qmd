Does race or gender impact your economic success in the U.S.?

Do more stereotypical Caucasian names have a higher chance of getting callbacks?

Do more stereotypical male names have a higher chance of getting callbacks?

Would the date of these data recorded have altered the results due to real-world events connections? (e.g. Pre/Post BLM)


1st Column: Name
2nd Column: Callback (0/1)

```{r}
library(dplyr)

file_path <- "data/resume.csv"
data <- read.csv(file_path)

# Organize the dataset
organized_data <- data %>%
  select(name = firstname, callback_status = call)

print(organized_data)
```
